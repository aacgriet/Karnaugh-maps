# Karnaugh-maps
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT : 
•	The objective of this project is to simplify a given Boolean expression using Karnaugh maps.
•	A Karnaugh map (K-map) is a pictorial method used to minimize Boolean expressions without having to use Boolean algebra theorems and equation manipulations.
•	This simplification will result in reduction of number of gates engaged in a circuit by minimizing the number of inputs per gate ( i.e., by reducing the number of min-terms or literals).
•	The minimization will reduce cost and power consumption, in turn increases the efficiency
